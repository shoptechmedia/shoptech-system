#Description
The JoliSearch module considerably improves the standard instant research provided by Prestashop. It of- fers a better visual experience for your clients : images and brands of your products are directly displayed in the results list. Moreover, the module handles typing errors and spelling mistakes for optimal search results.

#Common trouble-shouting
Problem : The module is oddly-placed on the webpage
Solution : You should change the position of the module in the back-office, through « Modules > Positions ». In the hook « Top of pages », make sure the module JoliSearch is at the same level as « Quick Search block » or higher. The module can also be hooked on the left or the right side of your theme.

Problem : Approximative search doesn’t seem to work / an error message appeared during installation
Solution : This may be due to access restrictions in your database configuration. Make sure the database user prestashop uses has the privileges « CREATE ROUTINE » and « EXECUTE ».
These may be activated under the tab privileges in phpmyadmin or with these instructions for mysql command line :
      GRANT CREATE ROUTINE, EXECUTE ON your_prestashop_database TO
      your_user@your_database_server_name
(see mysql documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/grant.html )
Afterward, you should reset the module for everything to work properly.

Problem : Instant search displays HTML code
Solution : Tick « yes » at « Enable Html Output Debug » in the configuration panel of the module to correct this problem.
